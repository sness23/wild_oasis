   Your cert will expire on 2020-12-01. To obtain a new or tweaked

NOTE: PEM files are similar to .DER certificate files, but contain
Base64-encoded text instead of binary data and are typically used by open source
(Linux and Unix) web servers instead of Windows web servers. .CER and .CRT files
are also saved in the PEM format but only store certificates.
